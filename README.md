# JET1
__Jewellery and Education Training, Level 1__ (JET1; 2022-2023), provided by The
National Association of Jewellers (NAJ; UK).

The naming system is a bit messy due to changes of mind during the course.
The completed/presentable assignments are found in the .pdf files:

- [Assignment_1.1-_to_1.12](Assignment_1.1-_to_1.12.pdf)
- [Assignment_2_complete](Assignment_2_complete.pdf)
- [Assignment_3_complete](Assignment_3_complete.pdf)
- [Assignment_4_complete](Assignment_4_complete.pdf)
- [CopyOfProject](CopyOfProject.pdf) (originally presented as [Project.html](Project.html) 
since RStudio lost the knit-to-pdf function (-_-), now reconverted to PDF, though 
the [HTML](Project.html) document looks better in my opinion).
