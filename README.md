# JET1

Jewellery and Education Training Level 1 (JET1; 2022-2023), provided by The
National Association of Jewellers (NAJ; UK).

The naming system is a bit messy due to changes of mind in the duration of the
course.
The completed/presentable assignments are found in the .pdf files:

- Assignment_1.1-_to_1.12.pdf
- Assignment_2_complete.pdf
- Assignment_3_complete.pdf
- Assignment_4_complete.pdf
- CopyOfProject.pdf (originally done as Project.html since RStudio lost the knit-to-pdf function (-_-), now reconverted to PDF).

All assignments achieved top marks and a pass for the course.
