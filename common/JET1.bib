  urldate = {2023-03-24},
  abstract = {White Metals are a popular choice for modern wedding or engagement rings. This popularity makes sense.~Silvery white precious metals are timeless and they compliment many skin tones. A variety of precious metals are naturally white in color, unlike yellow or rose, which are only available in gold alloys. Each type of metal has a slightly different hue as well as its own sets of benefits and drawbacks. Gold, Palladium, Platinum and Rhodium are individual elements on the periodic table. All have~unique properties that make them desirable for jewelry production. These characteristics affect the purity we need to use for jewelry alloys, as well as the metal density and the way it wears over time. Each precious metal is individually traded in the stock market. This means the prices of each metal fluctuate with supply and demand independent from one other. DECIDING WHICH WHITE METAL IS BEST FOR YOU BOILS DOWN TO THREE FACTORS:~MAINTENANCE, DENSITY, AND PRICE.~ Three precious metals covered in my~Guide to Precious Metals~will be used in the following head-to-head matchups : White Gold, Platinum, and Palladium. WHITE GOLD VS. PLATINUM~ White gold jewelry typically has a lower price point than platinum. A large part of this price difference is due to the fact that platinum alloy used contains 95\% platinum whereas a white gold ring will have 58.5\% (14 karat) to 75\% (18 karat) gold content. Platinum is also more dense, meaning a finished ring of the same size and shape weighs more. Platinum is hypoallergenic and naturally more white in color than white gold. White gold can be rhodium plated to achieve a whiter finish, but that plating will require extra maintenance over time. ~ For a full description of each of these metals, please read my~Guide to Precious Metals.~ WHITE GOLD VS. PLATINUM      ~ WHITE GOLD PLATINUM LOWER PRICE ✓ ~ PURITY 58.5\% - 75\% pure gold 90-95\% pure platinum WHITEST COLOR ~ ✓ HYPOALLERGENIC alloys containing Nickel are NOT hypoallergenic ✓ MAINTENANCE may require rhodium plating every 2 years high polished platinum will develop a worn patina over time WHITE GOLD VS. PALLADIUM~ Like platinum, palladium is hypoallergenic and naturally more white in color than white gold. It is used in the same purity as well, 95\% pure.~Palladium is less dense than gold or platinum, making the finished ring feel very lightweight. It's also the most scratch resistant of the white metals.~ The price of a finished ring in palladium typically falls between the price of a 14 karat gold ring and an 18 karat gold ring.~ For a full description of each of these metals, please read my~Guide to Precious Metals. WHITE GOLD VS. PALLADIUM      ~ WHITE GOLD PALLADIUM LOWER PRICE ✓ ~ PURITY 58.5\% - 75\% pure gold 90-95\% pure palladium WHITEST COLOR ~ ✓ HYPOALLERGENIC alloys containing Nickel are NOT hypoallergenic ✓ MAINTENANCE may require rhodium plating every 2 years more scratch resistant PALLADIUM VS. PLATINUM~ Palladium and platinum are both platinum family metals on the periodic table of elements. Both are used at 95\% purity in their alloys, but since palladium is less dense the finished ring will weigh less. Both metals are hypoallergenic and have a naturally white color which requires no rhodium plating. Both metals are excellent for stone setting and holding gems in place. Palladium's lighter weight and lower price tag are typical reasons one would choose palladium over platinum. ~ Platinum's rarity and significant weight are typical reasons one would choose platinum over palladium.~ For a full description of each of these metals, please read my~Guide to Precious Metals. PALLADIUM VS. PLATINUM      ~ PALLADIUM PLATINUM LOWER PRICE ✓ ~ PURITY 90-95\% pure platinum 90-95\% pure platinum WHITEST COLOR ~ ✓ HYPOALLERGENIC ✓ ✓ MAINTENANCE more scratch resistant high polished platinum will develop a worn patina over time RHODIUM PLATING As discussed in my~Precious Metals Comparison, many white gold alloys are rhodium plated. Rhodium is a precious metal in its own right and a member of the platinum family on the periodic table of elements. Coating your white gold jewelry in rhodium gives the metal a bright white color, but this layer eventually wears off. This plating usually needs to be reapplied every 1 to 2 years, but depending on the wearer’s body chemistry and wearing habits it could be as frequently as every 6 months.},

Indian culture differs from Western culture in the shared importance placed on the spiritual and ethnic values that permeate Indian life and imbue symbolic meaning into objects. Jewelry carries spiritual, ethnic meaning that underlies its use as a ritual artifact as the bride crosses the threshold of the extended family. This study examined the ritualistic use of jewelry during various occasions to develop insights into the Indian's perspective of possession meaning. As jewelry is lent or given to each new bride that enters the extended family, the jewelry grows heavier with nuanced meaning that becomes part of the legacy of the jewelry. Gifted and borrowed jewelry plays an indispensable role in the ritual purification and transformation of the bride from an 'other' commoditized female into part of the bridegroom's extended self and subsequent incorporation into the sacred domain of the extended family. Every traditional jewelry worn has sacred and ethnic meanings based in notions of auspiciousness that persist, even if a negative, indexical meaning profanes the possession. The Religious jewelry that is selected reflects one's consciousness and awareness at that moment and one's request for protection and blessings from the vast pantheon of Gods and Goddesses in their religion. Indian consumers seem comfortable with the temporal coexistence of sacred and profane meanings.},

  urldate = {2023-06-06},
  abstract = {When shopping for Jewellery, you will come across several terms, such as 18K gold, gold-filled, gold-plated, gold-vermeil, etc. It is very important to firstly know that all of these aren’t the same thing. It’s also then important to know and identify the differences between these terms.~~ ~ Let us tell you what 18K gold vermeil means and how it is different from gold-plated.~           18K Gold Vermeil – What is it?~              Pronounced as ver-may, the word has French origins. Very simply, it can be understood as plating with MUCH higher and strict standards. A technique can only be termed vermeil if it follows ALL of the below conditions:~              1. The base metal needs to be sterling silver. Sterling silver is when there’s a mix of 92.7\% silver along with a mix of other alloy metals to give your Jewellery a better shine and a longer life. No Jewellery made of brass, steel, or copper can be called 18K gold vermeil.~       2. The gold that’s used in this technique should be at least 10K or 10 karats. This means that the composition of the alloy used in plating should have at least 41.7\% real gold. Anything less than 10 karats gold will be considered as gold plating and not vermeil. We at Rachel Galley use 18 karat gold for vermeil.       3. And finally, the plating should be a minimum of 2.5 microns thick. One micron is 1/1000th of a millimeter, for your reference. This ensures that a relatively thicker and more reliable use of 18-karat gold is used in the plating process.~                             Is vermeil the same as gold-plated jewelry?       The answer is no; gold plating a much, much more affordable concept. The thickness of plating is 5X lesser than gold vermeil, only 0.5 microns (as opposed to 2.5 microns for gold vermeil). Gold plating also doesn’t necessarily require a strong base metal, anything from copper, brass, to steel can be used for plating.~~ In conclusion, gold plating can wear off very quickly, it also makes Jewellery prone to quicker degeneration and tarnishing.~The layer of gold used is also so thin that the colour and effect of gold fade away far quicker, making your Jewellery quite short term for use.~               We offer you an incredible collection of 18K gold Jewellery, including rings, earrings, pendants, charms, necklaces, and so much more. Not only do we bring you the standard excellence of 18K gold in our vermeil, but also use AAA-grade real natural gemstones that offer you spectacular shine and clarity.~ All of this we do is offered at marketing-beating prices and it is only possible because we eliminate middlemen from our process. We source our materials straight from the source, so we are able to cut down all costs in between and bring you pocket-friendly prices, even when we’re designer!~                           It’s important to note that 18K Gold is 75\% Pure solid Gold, which means that the layer of metal that surrounds the silver is going to 75\% pure gold! Vermeil is a technique of gold plating that involves a much thicker layer of gold (a minimum of 2.5 microns) over sterling silver. Process of 18K Gold Vermeil Technique To apply 18K gold vermeil technique, the base metal (standard sterling silver) is first cleaned and polished, and then plated with a layer of 18 karat gold with the help of electrolysis process. This creates a durable and long-lasting layer of gold that gives the jewellery a luxurious and high-end appearance.                      The next question we find answering the most is       Is 18K Gold Vermeil real gold?~ Yes, it most certainly is! A 2.5 micron-thick layer or REAL 18 karats gold is used on a sold base of sterling silver. When a standard use of electroplated gold plated Jewellery is made, it’s also real gold, but the coating of gold is incredibly thin, so it doesn’t retain the kind of shine that 18K gold vermeil does.~            Here are some questions that are asked more:             Is 18K Gold Vermeil better or gold plating?       ›            Is 18K gold vermeil waterproof?~       ›            18K gold vermeil hypoallergenic?~       ›            Can I buy 18K gold vermeil?       ›},

Argyle was at times the largest diamond producer in the world by volume (14 million carats in 2018), although the proportion of gem-quality diamonds was low. It was the only known significant source of pink and red diamonds (producing over 90\% of the world's supply), and additionally provided a large proportion of other naturally coloured diamonds, including champagne, cognac and rare blue diamonds. Mining operations ceased in November 2020, after 37 years of operations and producing more than 865 million carats of rough diamonds. Mine operator Rio Tinto planning to decommission the mine and rehabilitate the site at least through 2025.The Argyle diamond mine is also notable for being the first successful commercial diamond mine exploiting a volcanic pipe of lamproite, rather than the more usual kimberlite pipe; much earlier attempts to mine diamonds from a lamproite pipe in Arkansas, United States, were commercially unsuccessful. The Argyle mine is owned by the Rio Tinto Group, a diversified mining company which also owns the Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada and the Murowa diamond mine in Zimbabwe.},
